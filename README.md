# Comparison of Apollo Federation Rust vs Go Implementation

Uses Apollo Router (written in Rust) and a comparison of Rust and Go for implementing a lightweight spec GraphQL API.

Performance is secondary in this case to developer experience as a lightweight non-CPU heavy API will not have signifcant perfomance benefit/cost with either language choice.

This repo is designed to allow for an easy visual comparison of the code between Go and Rust for the same task.

Run via:

```shell script
./start.sh
```
